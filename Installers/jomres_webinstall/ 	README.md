This is the web installer script on it's own. To use it upload it to the root of your Joomla or Wordpress installation then run it by visiting www.domain.com/jomres_webinstall.php

Other installer scripts are essentially wrappers for this one, they'll provide a method of copying this file to the root of your site then triggering it.
